      <blockquote>"Definitely the greatest candy shop in Ottawa. The products are consistently delicious and reasonably priced. My personal favourites are the candy apples available year round. Staff is always very friendly and even gives my dog biscuits when we stop by on our walks. I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone with a mild to voracious sweet tooth.
